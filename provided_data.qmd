# loading data

You can simply use data that is natively provided by R.
A famous example is the titanic data set.
Do this using the `data()` command as provided below

```{webr}

data("Titanic")

```

There is not a lot that happened, because we do not use an IDE.
An IDE like RStudio would acutally display the variables.
This is a trade-off we have to live with the convinienct of not setting up R, but of course, there are ways around it.
Below are a couple of ways to display data:
- the `print`command is the most verbose way to output data
- the `head` command prints only the first couple of lines (can be specified using `head(object, n = X`)
- the `glimpse` command is very convenient, but needs the `dplyr` package to be loaded or referenced (with `::` as shown below)
- the `str` command give the structure of the object, so it provides a meta view of the variable. This is convenient if you have some unexpected output.

# inspecting data

```{webr}
print(Titanic)
```


```{webr}
head(Titanic)
```


```{webr}
dplyr::glimpse(Titanic)
```


```{webr}
str(Titanic)
```
