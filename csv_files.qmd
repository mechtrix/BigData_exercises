## csv

Reading a csv is fairly simple, we just need the file path.
Lucky for you this has been prepared, the file was already downloaded to the Virtual File System (VFS) that webR uses.
Classically, we can use the `read.csv()` function from baseR.
It is not as convenient, but you do not need to install or download any package to work with it.
Check out the variable content using the commands above!

```{webr}
flights_data_base <-  read.csv("data/flights.csv")
```

In the `tidyverse` we also have the [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. 
It give more flexibility, for example specifiying columns.
We do not need to care about that now, but it is good to know.

```{webr}
library(readr)
flights_data_readr <-  read_csv("data/flights.csv")

```

But we can also explore the VFS a little by using the `getwd()` and the `list.files()` command.
There you can see the `flights.csv` file that we read in before!
When you output the complete VFS - what do you notice?

```{webr}
getwd()

list.files()

list.files('/', full = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)

```
