---

This is the landing page for the Big Data exercises taught by [Prof. Dr. Tim Weber](https://github.com/mechtrix) at the [DIT](https://www.th-deg.de/en/campus-cham).
This is a more or less static page, for admin stuff got to [ilearn](https://ilearn.th-deg.de/).
The exercises are designed to run in the browser of your choice.
Feel free to setup `R` on your local machine, but do not expect support from us.
You can download `R` [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).
You can download `RStudio` (the free IDE for `R`) [here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
If you want to get things going, start [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
Packages for`R` can be downloaded from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), but this should be done from within `R`.
If you want to contribute or get packages that are not hosted on CRAN, you can setup a [Github account](https://github.com/), but this is purely optional.
