Letâ€™s try loading libraries!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we have loaded the dplyr package, which is used for data manipulation. It is part of the much bigger tidyverse. Since the packages always have to be installed, we will not use the more extensive command library(tidyverse). This would trigger to install a lot of packages. If you want to do this on your own machine, please do so"
