## API

Below you can try to get data from an API.
This is not yet possible using webR for technical and security reasons. 
In theory, it would go like this:

This is the Give Food API at [givefood.org.uk](https://www.givefood.org.uk/api/2/docs/) and shall give us a brief introduction on how to work with API's.
We need two packages: [httr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr) and [jsonlite](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=jsonlite).
We are pulling data from a data source that does not need a key [foodbank](https://www.givefood.org.uk/api/2/docs/).

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(httr)
library(jsonlite)

foodbank <- httr::GET("https://www.givefood.org.uk/api/2/foodbanks/")

foodbankcontent <- httr::content(foodbank, as = "text")

foodbankJSON <- jsonlite::fromJSON(foodbankcontent)

```

```

    "address": "Victory Hall\r\nLapford\r\nDevon\r\nEX17 6PZ",
    "postcode": "EX17 6PZ",
...
```

But we can "fake" an API call, just to be able to play around a little with json files.
For this we will download the data that is provided by the API as a csv and re-read it into R.

```{webr-r}
library(jsonlite)

foodbankRAW <- readLines("data/foodbank")

foodbankJSON <- jsonlite::fromJSON(foodbankRAW)

dplyr::glimpse(foodbankJSON)

```

Ok, so now we have data, but what can we do with it?
Below is some code where we count the foodbanks according to region in the UK.

```{webr-r}
cnt_foodbank <- foodbankJSON |> 
  count(country)
```

We then add a ordered barplot so show the counts.
Piece o' cake!

```{webr-r}
cnt_foodbank |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = reorder(country,-n),
      y = n
    )
  )+
  geom_col()+
  labs(
    title = "Count of foddbanks in the UK per region",
    x = "region",
    y = "count"
  )

```
